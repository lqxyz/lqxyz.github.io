  title={{SimCloud version 1.0: A simple diagnostic cloud scheme for idealized climate models}},
  author={Liu, Qun and Matthew Collins and Maher, Penelope and Thomson, Stephen I and Vallis, Geoffrey K},
  abstract={A simple diagnostic cloud scheme (SimCloud) for general circulation models (GCMs), which has a modest level of complexity and is transparent in describing its dependence on tunable parameters, is proposed in this study. The large-scale clouds, which form the core of the scheme, are diagnosed from relative humidity. In addition, the marine low stratus clouds, typically found off the west coast of continents over subtropical oceans, are determined largely as a function of inversion strength. A “freeze-dry” adjustment based on a simple function of specific humidity is also available to reduce an excessive cloud bias in polar regions. Other cloud properties, such as the effective radius of cloud droplet and cloud liquid water content, are specified as simple functions of temperature. All of these features are user-configurable. The cloud scheme is implemented in Isca, a modeling framework designed to enable the construction of GCMs at varying levels of complexity, but could readily be adapted to other GCMs. Simulations using the scheme with realistic continents generally capture the observed structure of cloud fraction and cloud radiative effect (CRE), as well as its seasonal variation. Specifically, the explicit low-cloud scheme improves the simulation of shortwave CREs over the eastern subtropical oceans by increasing the cloud fraction and cloud water path. The freeze-dry adjustment alleviates the longwave CRE biases in polar regions, especially in winter. However, the longwave CRE in tropical regions and shortwave CRE over the extratropics are both still too strong compared to observations. Nevertheless, this simple cloud scheme provides a suitable basis for examining the impacts of clouds on climate in idealized modeling frameworks.},

  abstract={Significant uncertainties exist in El Ni{\~n}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) simulations. To investigate the source of these uncertainties, previous studies have primarily focused on the model itself; however, internal climate variability (ICV) as a source of uncertainty has not been sufficiently explored to date. Using the Community Earth System Model–Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM–LME) modeling project and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), an investigation into uncertainties in simulated ENSO arising from ICV is performed. Results show that external forcing can significantly increase the uncertainties arising from ICV when the simulation length is greater than ~40 years. In addition, the spread in ENSO amplitude arising from ICV accounts for 50% of the total spread within the CMIP5 historical simulations. Finally, the impact of ICV on ENSO varies considerably with simulation length and stabilizes at the threshold of 300-400 years.}

  abstract={A novel full-field initialization strategy based on the dimension-reduced projection four-dimensional variational data assimilation (DRP-4DVar) is proposed to alleviate the well-known initial shock occurring in the early years of decadal predictions. It generates consistent initial conditions, which best fit the monthly mean oceanic analysis data along the coupled model trajectory in 1 month windows. Three indices to measure the initial shock intensity are also proposed. Results indicate that this method does reduce the initial shock in decadal predictions by Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System model, Grid-point version 2 (FGOALS-g2) compared with the three-dimensional variational data assimilation-based nudging full-field initialization for the same model and is comparable to or even better than the different initialization strategies for other fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models. Better hindcasts of global mean surface air temperature anomalies can be obtained than in other FGOALS-g2 experiments. Due to the good model response to external forcing and the reduction of initial shock, higher decadal prediction skill is achieved than in other CMIP5 models.},

  abstract={Reproducibility is a fundamental principle of scientific research. Bitwise identical reproducibility, i.e., bitwise computational results can be reproduced, guarantees the reproduction of exactly the same results. Here we show the importance of bitwise identical reproducibility to Earth system modeling but the importance has not yet been widely recognized. Modeled mean climate states, variability and trends at different scales may be significantly changed or even lead to opposing results due to a slight change in the original simulation setting during a reproduction. Out of the large body of Earth system modeling publications, few thoroughly describe the whole original simulation setting. As a result, the reproduction of a particular simulation experiment by fellow scientists heavily depends on the interaction with the original authors, which is often inconvenient or even impossible. We anticipate bitwise identical reproducibility to be promoted as a worldwide standard, to guarantee the independent reproduction of simulation results and to further improve model development and scientific research.},
