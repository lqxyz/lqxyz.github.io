I am currently a PhD student at Department of Mathematics, Univeristy of Exeter, studying climate science and supervised by Prof. [Matthew Collins](https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/mc369) and Prof. [Geoffrey Vallis](https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/gv219). My thesis is to understand the roles of climate feedbacks in climate system with simple climate models, and one major topic is to understand the underlying causes of the spread in cloud feedbacks. The model used in my study is [Isca](https://github.com/ExeClim/Isca), which is an idealized climate modeling framework developed at University of Exeter. Before coming to UK, I obtained my master degree in atmospheric science and bachelor degree in applied geophysics from China.

<!---
To understand the feedback processes with Isca, I have derived the radiative kernels for several radiation schemes in it and have developed a simple cloud scheme for it.
