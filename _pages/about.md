Currently I am a researcher at the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Weather Research Center for Monitoring Warning and Forecasting (Shenzhen Institute of Meteorological Innovation, [GBA-MWF](https://weather.sz.gov.cn/gbamwf/)), focusing on weather and climate risks and their potential impacts on the financial sector. Prior to joining GBA-MWF, I served as a Senior Algorithm Engineer (specializing in Natural Hazard and AI applications) at [Ping An](https://group.pingan.com/) Property & Casualty Insurance Company of China, one of the country’s leading insurance providers.


I got my PhD degree in Mathematics (Climate Science) from [Univeristy of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/), UK, supervised by Prof. [Matthew Collins](https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/4409-Mat-Collins) and Prof. [Geoffrey Vallis](https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/gv219). My thesis is to understand the roles of climate feedbacks in climate system with simple climate models, and one major topic is to understand the underlying causes of the spread in cloud feedbacks. The model used in my study is [Isca](https://github.com/ExeClim/Isca), which is an idealized climate modeling framework developed at University of Exeter. Prior to coming to UK, I obtained my master degree in atmospheric science and bachelor degree in applied geophysics from China.
